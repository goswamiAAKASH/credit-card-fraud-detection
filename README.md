# *Credit Card Fraud Detection*
This project is a machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a dataset of transaction records. The primary goal is to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on key features like transaction type, amount, and account balances.

# *Features*:
# 1.*Streamlit Web Application*:

A user-friendly interface for predicting transaction fraud.
Users can input transaction details and get predictions on whether a transaction is likely fraudulent.
Machine Learning Model:

Built using Scikit-learn’s Decision Tree Classifier.
Trained on labeled transaction data with features mapped for fraud detection.
# 2.*Visualizations*:

Decision Tree structure to understand the model’s decision-making.
Confusion Matrix for evaluating model performance.
PCA-based visualization of transaction patterns.
# 3.*Transaction Validation*:

The app ensures transactions follow logical rules before making predictions.
# 4.*Project Objectives*:
To leverage machine learning in identifying fraudulent transactions efficiently.
To provide an interactive platform for visualizing fraud patterns.
# *Tech Stack*:
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: Frontend for the web application.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For visualizations.
